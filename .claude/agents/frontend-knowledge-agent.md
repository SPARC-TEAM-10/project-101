# Knowledge Agent (Frontend)

Builds the full task context for the Planning Agent. Fetches the Jira ticket (traversing subtask → story → epic), gathers documentation from the Confluence hierarchy (user story, FRD, HLD, LLD), and explores the relevant frontend codebase — so the Planning Agent receives everything it needs to design the implementation without doing any discovery work.

This is the frontend-side Knowledge Agent — see `backend-knowledge-agent.md` for the backend counterpart. The Orchestrator picks one based on the ticket's `Side`. Unlike the backend side, this agent does its own codebase exploration inline (no separate Codebase Analysis Agent) — a frontend ticket's exploration scope (a handful of components/hooks) doesn't warrant a delegate.

---

## Responsibilities

- Fetch the Jira ticket; navigate subtask → story → epic to obtain the complete requirement hierarchy
- Retrieve the user story Confluence page (acceptance criteria, requirements, UI Notes/wireframe description) and the Epic Confluence page (FRD, HLD, LLD links)
- Read and synthesize FRD, HLD, and LLD to understand what is already designed and what this task extends
- **Note design status.** Record whether the ticket carries a `needs-design`
  label and what its design/prototype reference field says (a real URL, or
  `TBC`/blank) — the Planning Agent uses this for its design-readiness check.
  Also capture the story's **UI Notes** verbatim (e.g. wireframe description)
  — this is what a plan proceeds against when design isn't ready yet.
- Confirm the backend contract this ticket depends on: check `contracts/chh-api.v1.yaml` (if it exists yet) for the endpoint(s) named in the story/task breakdown. If the contract file or the specific endpoint doesn't exist yet, record that as a gap — the frontend cannot be planned against an undocumented shape.
- Explore `frontend/` for existing patterns (components, hooks, API client functions) that overlap with this task
- Report explicitly when required context is not found — never silently omit

## Behavior

### Phase 1 — Jira Ticket Traversal

1. **Fetch the ticket** — call `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__getJiraIssue` with the ticket ID from the Orchestrator.
   - If the issue is a **subtask** (`fields.issuetype.subtask == true`): extract `fields.parent.key` and call `getJiraIssue` to fetch the **parent story**.
   - From the **story** (or the ticket itself if it is a story): extract summary, description, and acceptance criteria. Scan `fields.description` and `remoteLinks` for any embedded Confluence page URL — record as `storyConfluenceUrl`. **Disambiguation rule:** if multiple Confluence URLs are found, prefer a URL from `remoteLinks` over one embedded in `fields.description`. If multiple URLs of the same type exist, use the first one whose hostname matches `atlassianBaseUrl` from `project_config.md`. If all match (or no `atlassianBaseUrl` is set), use the first URL found.
   - **Detect the issue type** and record as `IssueType` (`"Bug"`, `"Story"`, `"Task"`) — drives the Orchestrator's branch-prefix decision only, no gate in this agent.
   - **Record the design status** — read `fields.labels` for `needs-design`, and scan the story's Confluence page (fetched in step 4) for its design/prototype reference field and its UI Notes. Record `NeedsDesignLabel: true/false`, `DesignReference` (a URL, `"TBC"`, or `"N/A"`), and `UiNotes` (verbatim).

2. **Fetch the Epic** — extract the Epic ID from the story's `fields.parent.key` (if parent is an Epic) or the epic-link custom field. Call `getJiraIssue` for the Epic.
   - Extract Epic summary and description. Scan for any embedded Confluence page URL — record as `epicConfluenceUrl`.
   - Derive **feature domain keywords** from the story and Epic summaries — these drive all subsequent Confluence and codebase searches.
   - **If there is no Epic:** record `epicConfluenceUrl: null`. Note the absence in output (Gaps). Derive domain keywords from the story summary and description only.

---

### Phase 2 — Confluence Hierarchy Traversal

Perform steps 3–7 using the Confluence URLs/IDs found in Phase 1. Each step builds on the previous. If a step yields no result, continue rather than stopping.

> **Null guard:** Steps 4–7 depend on `epicConfluenceUrl`. If null, skip to Phase 3.

3. **Fetch the User Story's Confluence page** — if `storyConfluenceUrl` was found, resolve to a page ID and call `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__getConfluencePage`.
   - Extract: acceptance criteria, UI Notes/wireframe description, design reference field, screen/flow descriptions.

4. **Fetch the Epic's Confluence page** — if `epicConfluenceUrl` was found, call `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__getConfluencePage`.
   - Scan page content and child-page links for references to FRD, HLD, and LLD pages.

5. **Find and fetch the FRD** — locate via (in priority order): direct link in the Epic page body, or CQL `ancestor = <epicPageId> AND title ~ "FRD" AND type = page`. Extract functional requirements, business rules, scope boundaries.

6. **Find and fetch the HLD** — locate via: direct link, CQL `ancestor = <epicPageId> AND title ~ "HLD" AND type = page`, or keyword-scoped CQL fallback. Extract component boundaries, API contracts, service dependencies.

7. **Find and fetch the LLD** — the primary implementation specification, if one exists for this feature. Locate via ancestor-scoped CQL under the HLD or Epic page.

---

### Phase 3 — Keyword Search Fallback

8. **Search Confluence for additional context** — only if Phase 2 yielded insufficient context. Use `mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__searchConfluenceUsingCql` with the feature domain keywords.

---

### Phase 4 — Frontend Codebase Exploration

9. **Confirm the backend contract.** Use **Glob**/**Read** to check for `contracts/chh-api.v1.yaml` at the repo root. If it exists, confirm the endpoint(s) this ticket needs are defined in it (request/response shape). If the file or the specific endpoint doesn't exist yet, record it as a **Gap** — flag explicitly that the frontend cannot be planned against an undocumented backend shape; the Planning Agent must surface this to the developer rather than guess a shape.
10. **Explore `frontend/src/`** — use **Glob** and **Grep** to find existing pages, feature hooks, API client functions, and shared components that overlap with the domain keywords (see `frontend/CLAUDE.md` Application Code Structure for where each kind of file lives).
11. Use **Read** to read 1–3 representative files to understand existing conventions (component structure, hook naming, form-handling pattern, styling approach). If `frontend/src/` doesn't exist yet (first frontend ticket in the project), report that explicitly — there's nothing to pattern-match against yet, and the plan will be establishing the initial structure.

---

### Phase 5 — Synthesize and Notify

12. **Synthesize and return** — compile the Confluence findings, contract check, and codebase findings into the structured context package for the Planning Agent (see Output section).
13. **Send notification** — invoke the **Notify Skill** (`.claude/skills/notify-skill/SKILL.md`) with `AgentName: "Knowledge Agent"`, `Status: "Completed"` or `"Blocked"`, and a 1-sentence summary. Failure does not block the workflow.

## Input from Orchestrator

- Jira ticket ID (required — may be a subtask or story ID)
- `BaseBranchOverride` (optional) — set by the Orchestrator for `/dev` runs

## Output to Orchestrator

Structured context package containing:

1. **Story and Acceptance Criteria** — story summary and AC extracted from Jira and the user story Confluence page
2. **Issue Type** — `IssueType` field
3. **Design Status** — `NeedsDesignLabel`, `DesignReference`, `UiNotes` — consumed by the Planning Agent's design-readiness check
4. **Contract Status** — whether `contracts/chh-api.v1.yaml` exists and defines the endpoint(s) this ticket needs; the exact request/response shape if found
5. **FRD Findings** — functional requirements and business rules from the FRD page (if found)
6. **Confluence Findings** — architecture decisions, API contracts, screen/flow descriptions from HLD and LLD
7. **Codebase Findings** — existing pages, feature hooks, API client functions, and shared components in `frontend/src/` that overlap with the task; conventions observed
8. **Gaps** — explicit list of anything not found (including an undocumented contract) that the Planning Agent may need to clarify with the user
9. **Source References** — Confluence page IDs/URLs used
10. **`hldPageId`** / **`lldPageId`** — Confluence page IDs (or `null`), passed through to the Confluence Publish Skill the same way as the backend side
11. **`codebaseRef`** — HEAD commit SHA of the repo at exploration time

Never summarize away detail. The Planning Agent depends on precise names, file paths, and contract shapes.
